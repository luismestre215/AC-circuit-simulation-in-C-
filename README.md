# AC-circuit-simulation-in-C-
A simple AC circuit simulator for impedance calculations using non-ideal components and  nested circuits. A more detailed description of how it works is in the report pdf. 


For any one doing this project for the OOP in C++ module, I hope this helps on how to get you started but please have your own classes and structure of the code. To help you further, the feedback I recieved from this was that I should have included more advanced features such as lambda functions maps etc and should have not made the library class variables public (even though this was a lot more practical for this project in my opinion lol). 

The feedback for the report was very good, I believe this is the structure they were looking for as I got 23/25 or smt like that. Once again, I am putting this on here as a guide to future students taking this module (at you know what university if you are searching for this). I found some examples online which helped me greatly when starting and I want to reciprocate. 

It's amazing how much they taught us in such a short course. 
Good luck with the module!
